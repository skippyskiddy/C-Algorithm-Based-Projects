# C-Algorithm-Based-Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects that I have completed as part of my ongoing programming journey. These projects cover a range of topics, including sorting algorithms, data structures, and algorithm analyses.

Notable projects include:

* [Analysis of Fibonacci Series](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/C-Algorithm-Based-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20Fibonacci%20Sequence): An analysis of Fibonacci series algorithms using iterative, recursive, and dynamic programming techniques. The project includes implementation of the algorithms in C and another language of choice, as well as a report on the empirical data and a comparison of experiences between the two languages.

* [Sort Analysis](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/C-Algorithm-Based-Projects/tree/main/Sorting%20Algorithm%20Implementation): An analysis of different sorting algorithms including bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. The project includes implementation of the algorithms in C and an experiment to compare their runtimes.

* [Doubly Linked List Implementation](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/C-Algorithm-Based-Projects/blob/main/Doubly%20Linked%20List/README.md): A project where I implemented a DLL, allowing me to get a better appreciation for memory management, struct creation, and data structures in low-level languages.

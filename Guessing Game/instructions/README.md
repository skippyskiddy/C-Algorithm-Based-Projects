# Homework 02 - Guessing Game Instructions

Your goal for this assignment is to write a guessing game program in C. You will use everything you learned in CS 5001, but instead of python, you will be learning the fundamentals of C. This project will take a lot of research and figuring out the syntax.  It is important to start early, and submit often.

## Specifications

* Your player will play the guessing game a total of 5 times in a row. (5 rounds)
* Each round a new number must be randomly generated generate a number from 1 to 10.
* The player will guess a number.
  * If the number is correct, then the round ends.
  * If the number is wrong, then a hint should be provided whether the correct number is higher or lower.
* After the five rounds have completed, it will report how many guesses it took for each round. 
  * The final output should look similar to the following (as we will be using it for grading):
   ```text
   Round 1 took you 1 guesses.
   Round 2 took you 3 guesses.
   Round 3 took you 2 guesses.
   Round 4 took you 5 guesses.
   Round 5 took you 1 guesses.
   ```
* You do not have to worry about invalid input. A player will always enter a number, and you can ignore if
the number is higher or lower than 10 (is still counts as a guess, even if out of the 10 range)
* You *must* use the template provided
  * DO NOT reset the random seed! We are setting the random seed in the main, so we can test the program with a different main.
* You should provide your own unit tests for the program where you checked for program validity. 

üëâüèΩ **Task**: Turn in a completed program along with unit tests. 

For reference, here is some sample game output. You are free to modify it slightly, as long as the last 5 lines follow the same format. 

### Sample Game Output
```console
> clang -Wall game_main.c -o game.out
> ./game.out

### Provided File Details:

* [guess_game.h](../guessing_game.h) - this is the primary file that will contain your code. Please use `start()` as the entry point for your program
* [game_main.c](../game_main.c) - the launch / entry point for your program. These are often system specific things, such as setting the random seed. 
* [game_tests_main.c](../game_tests_main.c) - the file to place your unit tests. We have also provided some sample code on how
to set the random to not be as random. 

### Hints
* You will want to use `rand()` to generate a random number (see example line in game_tests_main.c)
* Make sure to break up the code into smaller functions. 
  * In our implementation one function was only one line. Don't be afraid of making them short, C compilers are really good at optimizing your code if the functions are small.
* Make sure to document, that includes [README.md](../README.md) 
  * Make sure to cite your sources
* Make sure to do a lot of commits after each change (see below for example work flow)

## üìù Grading Rubric


1. Learning (AG)
   * Code compiles **without** any warnings.
2. Approaching  (AG)
   * Code runs the basic game (some output shows up)
3. Meets  (AG)
   * Program runs with a variety of input, showing proper output based on everything submitted. 
4. Exceeds  (MG)
   * README.md updated (including sources cited)
     * Answers questions correctly.
   * Student followed single(ish) task per function design principle 
   * Student made and documented unit tests
   * Code fully documented and easy to follow (including header portion with student names)
   * Student has at least 3 commits with informative messages


AG - Auto-graded  
MG - Manually graded

TAs will look at manually graded portions *after* you have met full points on the autograded (you may resubmit). You may also resubmit MG components, but there will be a time delay for TAs to grade (usually a week).

### Submission
You will submit to gradescope via it pulling from your Github repository generated by Github classroom. As a reminder,
gradescope doesn't auto pull. If you make an update, and already submitted to gradescope you will need to go into gradescope and resubmit.

### Github Commit Guide
Assignment work flow tends to be similar to the following:

* Open up your .c / .h file in a text editor
* Write or change a very small number of lines of code (sometimes just one change!)
* Save the text file
* Recompile your program `gcc -Wall main.c -o main.out` (or something similar)
* Run your program ./main and see if it does what you think it should be doing at this stage
  * This doesn't have to be a working program, but maybe a test you setup or print out!
* git add and git commit -m "your changes here" with the information about what you've added or changed
* Repeat!

This is the full "edit, save, compile, run, commit" cycle. It's very important that you follow this pattern for this assignment and throughout the semester! Write just a few lines of code, compile and check for warnings, and run your program. In fact, every time your program has a change in it, you should git commit the change and document it. 

Practice this pattern for this assignment and all assignments going forward! It's a crucial part of professional coding to get used to checking and committing small changes to your code base. 

Sometimes it may seem overkill, but it will make a difference as code bases get larger. 


## Compiling and Running Your Assignment
For this assignment, you may use the clang or gcc compiler. Both are industry standard compilers for compiling C programs (in addition to many other programming languages). Sometimes trying different compilers will given you more informative or helpful error messages--either one is perfectly fine for this course! 


Here is a way you will compile your code on the terminal.

```console
clang -Wall game_main.c -o game.out
```

or

```console
gcc -Wall game_main.c -o game.out
```
Both achieve the same thing.

1. First the compiler is specified.
2. Then a 'space' follows, and then the '.c' file we want to compile.
3. `-o` is a flag abbreviated for output. Items that begin with dash marks in general are compiler flags.
   * In this case the 'output' file we will generate(if there are no errors) will be called 'main'
   * Note: This 'game.out' file is a binary file that we can execute. This is different than 'main.c' which has the .c extension, and is a text file.
4. Finally, to execute your program, you will type in: ./game.out

While the extension is optional, anything with `.out` is ignored when syncing with Github (see [.gitignore](../.gitignore)). This saves from storing unneeded binary finals in your git history.

**Tip:** Sometimes compiling on both gcc and clang can give you different sets of warnings or errors that the other compiler could not catch.

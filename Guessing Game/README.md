## Summary

This project required generating a new number from 1 to 10 for each of the five rounds and allowing the player to guess the number. If the guess is correct, the round ends. Otherwise, a hint is provided to indicate whether the correct number is higher or lower. After completing the five rounds, the program reports the number of guesses it took for each round. The program must be submitted with unit tests, and the template provided must be used without resetting the random seed.

The project was challenging but rewarding, as it provided an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of C and practice important programming skills. One takeaway from this project is that breaking up the code into smaller functions makes it easier to manage and maintain. Additionally, documenting the code and citing sources is important for future reference and understanding.

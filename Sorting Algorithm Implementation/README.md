## Summary

In this project, I implemented two Quadratic Sorts: Insertion and Substitution sort. I also ran an experiment to get timings for the sorts, and thought deeply on the sorts and how to compare the different algorithms.

The project built directly on Workshop 05 - Bubble Sort and Workshop 06 - Merge Sort, which I had completed previously with a partner. To complete the assignment, I copied the bubble sort of my lab into sorts.h and implemented the selection sort and insertion sort.

I placed comments in the lines explaining what each line does, as the goal of the project was to demonstrate understanding. The selection sort sorts by finding the lowest value and swapping it with the first value it has yet to move, while the insertion sort inserts value into their correct location, assuming the left-hand side (even if it is one item) is sorted.

I used tester.c to generate a table of timings based on total values sorted. I also answered questions specific to my analysis inside Report.md, including creating a line chart to visually compare the growth of the different algorithms.

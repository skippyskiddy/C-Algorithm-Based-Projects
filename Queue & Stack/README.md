## Summary

For this project, I was required to write my own queue and stack libraries. It was important to understand various ways they are implemented and work since they are frequently used in computer science. I had to essentially write a library rather than an independent program, which meant unit testing became essential, and my final deliverable did not have any output to standard out or read from standard in.

For the queue implementation, I had to implement the myqueue.h file, and corresponding unit test file, test_queue.c. Each function was required, and I was not allowed to change the function definitions, structs, typedef, or defines. I used a Circular Buffer to implement the queue, which is a more efficient implementation than a simple array. I had to make sure my queue did not overwrite any data, and I added additional functions and unit tests as needed.

Similarly, for the stack implementation, I had to implement the mystack.h file, and corresponding unit test file, test_stack.c. Each function was required, and I was not allowed to change the function definitions, structs, typedef, or defines. I used a LinkedList to implement the stack, and I had to make sure to add additional unit tests to test_stack.c. I noticed that the functions were still called enqueue and dequeue even though it is a stack, and it is common for libraries to use common names. This was a hint towards object-oriented programming and making structures interchangeable.

## Summary 

In this project, I implemented a doubly-linked list. A doubly-linked list not only maintains a pointer to the next node in the list but also the previous one. By adding a previous field to our node, our list knows who comes before and after it.

To complete this project, I used the provided templates, including my_dll.h, main.c, and dll_tests.c, to implement various functions defined in my_dll.h. The main.c file is used solely for the implementation. On the other hand, the dll_tests.c file provides sample tests and a framework to add my own tests.

To implement the doubly linked list, I defined a Node struct that contained a data element and pointers to the previous and next nodes in the list. I also defined a LinkedList struct that contained pointers to the head and tail nodes of the list.

I then implemented functions to add and remove nodes from the list, as well as functions to search for nodes by value or index. In addition, I implemented functions to traverse the list forwards and backwards and to print the list to the console.

Overall, implementing a doubly linked list in C was a challenging but rewarding exercise that helped me to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and memory management.

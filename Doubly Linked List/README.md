## Summary 

In this project, I implemented a doubly-linked list. A doubly-linked list not only maintains a pointer to the next node in the list but also the previous one. By adding a previous field to our node, our list knows who comes before and after it.

To complete this project, I used the provided templates, including my_dll.h, main.c, and dll_tests.c, to implement various functions defined in my_dll.h. The main.c file is for my use only, and the program won't look at it. On the other hand, the dll_tests.c file provides sample tests and a framework to add my own tests. Testing is essential as it can not only find errors but also give me a repeatable way to validate my code.

Overall, this project gave me a better understanding of doubly-linked lists and the importance of testing. I learned that drawing a picture of the functions helped me visualize the processes and how each node interacts with the other. Additionally, testing my code thoroughly allowed me to identify errors and validate my code's accuracy.
